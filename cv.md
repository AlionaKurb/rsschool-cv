# Aliona Kurbatskaya CV 

I'm from Belarus, 34 y old, and trying to pass this course first time. So I'm a total beginner in this field. Sure, I have learned a basic coding principles at school and university (Belarusian National Technical University), but that was Delphi (objective Pascal) and that is not deep knowlege. Recently I started FreeCodeCamp course, and I hope it will help me to complete some tasks in this course. I very love what I'have studied already and believe that course helps me to gain my skills and knowlege in web-dew.
